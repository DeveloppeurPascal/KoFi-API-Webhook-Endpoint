# Ko-fi API webhook endpoint

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

Whether you are streamer on Twitch, youtubeur, tiktoker or content creator, musician, cartoonist, actor or artist, software developer, mobile applications or video games, author or publisher, if you use [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/) to receive donations or payments it may be useful to know in real time. It allows you to automate your deliveries, display alerts, receive notifications or emails.

Ko-fi offers a very simple API to do what you want with [a webhook](https://ko-fi.com/manage/webhooks). They are told the URL of an online program. They call it each time they get a payment.

It's up to us to do something about it then...

## Use

In this code repository you will find a folder "src" containing the PHP program "kofi-webhook.php", subfolders and other files.

Set it up with your control token, install it all on your website (preferably in a complicated folder not to fall on it by chance) and give its URL to Ko-fi.

At each call (so each payment) the program checks the consistency of what it receives and stores the data in a file in the subfolder "kofi-data" in the form "AAMMJJHHMMSS-xxx.json" (AAAA for the year, MM for the month, JJ for the day, HH for the moment, MM for the minutes, SS for the seconds and xxx as the random alphanumeric value).

All you have to do is browse this folder regularly to process its content and do what you need.

If you want to go further and don't know how to program or don't know how to install all this don't hesitate to [contact me](https://trucs-de-developpeur-web.fr/nous-contacter.php). I can do this for you in the form of service delivery or exchange.
